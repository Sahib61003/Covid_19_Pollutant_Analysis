# COVID-19 Pollutant Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between air pollutants and confirmed COVID-19 cases. The dataset used for this analysis is provided in the `dataforpaper.csv` file. The analysis is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook named `covid_19.ipynb`.

## Dataset

The primary dataset for this project is stored in the `dataforpaper.csv` file. The dataset contains information related to COVID-19 cases and various air pollutants. Here are the key pollutants included in the dataset:

- PM2.5 (ug/m3)
- PM10 (ug/m3)
- NO (ug/m3)
- NO2 (ug/m3)
- NH3 (ug/m3)
- SO2 (ug/m3)
- CO (mg/m3)

## Jupyter Notebook - `covid_19.ipynb`

The analysis and modeling are carried out in the Jupyter Notebook named `covid_19.ipynb`. The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and gain insights.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling, handling missing values, and addressing any data quality issues.

3. **Feature Engineering:** If necessary, creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the modeling process.

4. **Model Implementation:** Employing machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., to understand the impact of pollutants on the confirmed COVID-19 cases.

5. **Results and Visualizations:** Presenting the results of the analysis through visualizations and summaries.
